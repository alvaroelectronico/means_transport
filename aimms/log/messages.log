CPLEX: If you want to find out whether the problem is infeasible or unbounded then try to run it with the CPLEX
       option 'Presolve' set to 'no'. If the model is infeasible then you might want to switch on the general
       solvers option 'Infeasibility finder' to let CPLEX print an irreducible infeasibility set (IIS) to the listing file.
Warning: After zero iterations the preprocessor of CPLEX 20.1 concluded that mpMinCost is infeasible or unbounded.
